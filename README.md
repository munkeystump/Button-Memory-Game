# Switching-Game
Switching game where some buttons will turn leds on and others will turn all leds off (object is to get all leds on)

The idea is to have a series of momentary buttons for players to press. The objective is to get all leds to be switched on. Some buttons will switch a collection of leds on, other buttons will switch all leds off.
The puzzle is essentially a memory game, which series of buttons need to be pressed to trigger the lock...

Currently used with a matrix of 20 momentary buttons where 12 buttons will switch on a series of red leds mounted inside white roses, and the remaining 8 buttons will turn all leds off. Players have to press each of the 12 correct buttons in any order WITHOUT pressing any of the reset buttons.
